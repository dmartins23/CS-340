How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

 I created a readable, maintainable, and adaptable program by using organizing my code with proper indentations and comments that explain certain lines of code. 
By using variables and naming that can be used in other projects this code is very adaptable. 
How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?
Breaking a project into smaller steps has been a very helpful tool for this project. The first step was building the CRUD module to query the database. Then I made a Create function to make a new entry into the database. Then I moved on to Read, Delete, and Update functions. Creating an interface in CRUD Phyton will be carried into future projects. 


What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?
   
Computer Sciences define a problem at hand and take steps to solve these problems. Giving Grazioso Salvare the data they want in a simple and easy to read manner will help the company run more efficiently and get tasks done faster.
